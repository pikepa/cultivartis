                <div class="text-justify">
                    <p>As a CTO/VP Engineering & Operations I had been buying Managed Services on behalf of operators for over 20 years across 18 different countries. Likewise, having worked for three global Managed Service vendors each Managed Service contract being different both in scope, price, each Managed Service contract had its own nuances, like KPI and SLA’s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I found a lot of operators had never scoped or purchased a large Network Managed service, they simply needed help in pulling the full remit together. Matters got worse about 5 years ago as the Wireless Telco Managed Service Industry market saturation took place, plus a few years ago with the advent of OTT -It was clear the pressure was on in regards to reducing Network Operating costs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scope of Managed Service contracts simply got broader and deeper as operators fought with trying to deal with operational cost reduction in order to stay competitive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vendor Managed Service expertise also improved dramatically as they took on more operator Managed Service contracts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also found that a lot of Managed Service contracts and Managed Service managers lacked the essential operational skills and detail, often with the end result 12 months into a Managed Service contract the two factions (operator and vendor) would be in dispute, mostly over contract details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We saw a need for both parties to be fully transparent and have the desired will to make the end to end Managed Service process successful, only this way will the customer experience increase in value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I empathise with Managed Service vendors and Operator…for the operator its probably their first time they will have operationally outsourced a substantial part of their network operations. Likewise the Managed Service vendor has to have deep technical knowledge and management skills in order to assume the day to day control of a transferred Nationwide Network-both parties needed help and understanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bruce Peterson and I decided to help the industry by writing 'The Erlang Enigma' , which allows Managed Service operatives to understand the strategies, workings, different stages, policies, and performance characteristics of a Telco Managed Service, we believe in the saying “focus on the things you can’t see”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short The Erlang Enigma allows the reader to “see” a lot of the hidden issues while constructing and operating the Managed Service contract. I believe we have bought deeper understanding, more expertise, and a quasi-financial /business/ engineering order to the Telecom’s Managed service industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We want Managed Service to be the right thing to do for both operator and Vendor alike. In order to maximise operational efficiency, we also believe both parties should act as one fully transparent team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are so passionate about what we do we have taken Managed Service to the next level by offering two essentials, a free Cultivartis Managed Service consultation and the idea that the Managed Service industry should create its own Telco Managed Service practitioner qualification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We do hope you enjoy the The Erlang Enigma experience….
