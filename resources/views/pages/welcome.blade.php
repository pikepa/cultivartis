            <p class="mt-2 text-justify text-gray-700"> Managed services within the telecoms industry and particularly the mobile industry is with us to stay, there is no doubt of that. When we look to the future there is a vast array of services that can be outsourced and synergised in this way to draw on potential economy of scale. Day to day O & M is by no means the “be all and end all” of the service proposition. But in order to unlock the potential benefits, and they are vast, we need a global standard. In this way we can harmonise our efforts and create transportable results. <strong>The Erlang Enigma’s</strong> primary objective is to create that standard.

            <p class="mt-2 text-justify text-gray-700">Throughout our careers Bruce and I have had the privilege of working in something approaching 75 different countries, with operators and vendors who all have creatively added to the industry's sum total of knowledge and wisdom. But we saw that there was no single reference, no accumulation of the so called “best practises” that could be used to create a global standard for the management and performance of our networks.

We have standards for international commerce and trade, standards for logistics etc. In short, we can buy an Oldsmobile in Australia and it will be essentially identical to one purchased in the United States, save for legal compliance matters.

                No matter if we are going into managed services for the first time or we are renewing a managed services contract, without doubt we have our own ideas, thoughts and perceptions. What the Erlang Enigma does is provide the strategy for success.

            <p class="mt-2 text-justify text-gray-700">The Erlang Enigma is the foundation stone of the strategist approach to our global community. The Erlang Enigma is a first of it’s kind in many ways; not only is it the first attempt to formalise and logicalise our approach to telecoms, it is the first point of reference, the first document which seeks to bring all the key processes and procedures together and therefore it is a unique de facto standard not for international communications but for truly “Global Communication”. It is a gateway to the future. Our business is to enable every citizen to be heard. Therefore it our responsibility to ensure that is provided as cost effectively and as simply as possible.
